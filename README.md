Lipidome alterations in cholestatic liver disease

This directory contains the code for generating lipidome alterations in a mouse model of cholestatic liver disease

The LC-MS/MS data was generated by Shimadzu Nexera - Sciex QTrap 5500, metabolites and lipids were quantified with Biocrates targeted metabolomic kit and further annotated. The data was proccessed by Metaboanalyst 5.0, filteredd for low-abundance compounds, normalized by median, log-tarnsformed, and exported for visualization. Here we provide the code to generate lipid profile plots based on the exported data. To avoid the batch effect that could be caused by differences between the cohorts, we consider the two studies (mice terated by diet and mice treated by diet and AAV) separately. 

The following scripts plot the distribution of lipid species, one for each lipid class.

In mice treated by diet:

diet_pc_concentrations.R - distribution of PC class lipids;
diet_pe_concentrations.R - distribution of PE class lipids;
diet_pi_concentrations.R - distribution of PI class lipids;
diet_cer_concentrations.R - distribution of ceramide class lipids

In mice treated by diet and AAV:

diet_aav_pc_concentrations.R - distribution of PC class lipids;
diet_aav_pe_concentrations.R - distribution of PE class lipids;
diet_aav_pi_concentrations.R - distribution of PI class lipids;
diet_aav_cer_concentrations.R - distribution of ceramide class lipids
